OpenSource Licence of the Hasso-Plattner Institute

This computer program can be used by anyone in accordance with the OpenSource
licence of the Hasso-Plattner Institute. Its terms of use can be downloaded
under the URL https://github.com/hyrise/nvm_malloc/blob/master/LICENSE

Preamble

The Hasso-Plattner-Institut für Softwaresystemtechnik GmbH, Prof.-Dr.-Helmert-
Strasse 2-3, 14482 Potsdam, hereinafter referred to as Hasso-Plattner
Institute, provides a research in-memory database storage engine system to
store different kinds of relational and other data. This software shall
hereinafter be referred to as nvm_malloc.


1. Licence Grant

With these terms of use, the Hasso-Plattner Institute grants everyone, free of
charge, a non-exclusive right of use (§ 32(3)(3) Copyright Act) in nvm_malloc. It
therefore makes an offer to everyone to conclude a corresponding licence
agreement for the grant of exploitation rights in accordance with these terms
of use. The express acceptance by the Hasso-Plattner Institute need not be
received by the user (§ 151 German Civil Code).  The above rule means that the
user cannot assign the right of use ac-quired by it in accordance with these
terms of use to a third party, but that the third party acquires the rights
directly from Hasso-Plattner Institute.


2. Scope of Exploitation Rights

With these terms of use, the Hasso-Plattner Institute grants the user, free of
charge, a non-exclusive right of use, unrestricted with respect to time and
geographical scope, to use nvm_malloc in accordance with the following terms:

    a)  The user shall be entitled to reproduce, distribute and/or publish
        the source code of nvm_malloc.

    b)  The user may also translate, adapt, arrange or otherwise alter the
        source code of nvm_malloc and exploit the results under Point 2.a)

    c)  Finally, the user may also exploit the text of these licence terms in
        accordance with Point 2.a).

    d)  The exploitation rights pursuant to Point 2.a) and b) also apply to
        nvm_malloc in its object code or executable form and entitle the user to in-
        corporate nvm_malloc into other computer programs for use as set down in
        Point 2, though these terms of use only apply to the part of the new
        computer program so created which is nvm_malloc where the combination does
        not result in a change pursuant to Point 2.b). In the latter case,
        these terms of use apply to the entire new computer program.



3. Duties of the User

The user shall be obliged,

    a)  on reproduction of nvm_malloc pursuant to Point 2.a), to incorporate the
        following copyright mark, at least in the corresponding source code:
        „Exclusive copyrighted exploitation rights / Copyright © 2014
        Hasso-Plattner-Institut für Softwaresystemtechnik GmbH“
        as well as to include a copy of these terms of use; in the case of
        publication, the terms of use must also be included in the offer of
        publication;

    b)  not to remove references in the source code and in other places to the
        owner of rights of use and these terms of use and/or to change such;

    c)  for the case that the user make changes to nvm_malloc pursuant to Point
        2.b) and so acquires its own copyright, the work so created may only
        be offered to third parties for use/edit in accordance with these
        terms of use; the user must also make these changes clear in the
        source code;

    d)  for the case that the user uses nvm_malloc in object code form or in
        executable form, it must also include the complete machine-readable
        source code for nvm_malloc on the data carrier and/or make it accessible
        to the public via the Internet; for the case that the user combines
        nvm_malloc pursuant to Point 2 d) with another computer program, it must
        ensure in any offer of the same that nvm_malloc is also included in this
        entire program and that this is only used in accordance with these
        terms of use.



4. Consequence of Breach of the Above Obligations

Should the user commit a culpable breach of any of the obligations set down in
Point 3, all exploitation rights under these terms of use shall terminate
automatically, also with retrospective effect.



5. Limited Liability

    a)  The Hasso-Plattner Institute shall have unlimited liability for damage
        due to legal defects or absence of warranted qualities as well as for
        injury to life, body and health. Liability for initial inability,
        delay and impossibility shall be limited to such damage typically
        foreseeable of such a computer program.

    b)  In all other regards, the Hasso Plattner Institute shall have
        unlimited liability only for deliberate damage or damage caused by
        gross negligence, also by its legal representative and managers. With
        respect to the fault of other vicarious agents, the Hasso-Plattner
        Institute shall only be liable to the extent of liability for initial
        inability in accordance with the previous section.

    c)  For negligence simpliciter, the Hasso-Plattner Institute shall only be
        liable where the obligation breached is of particular importance for
        attaining the contract purpose, a duty which gives the contract its
        specific character and in which the user may trust (cardinal duty). In
        case of breach of a cardinal obligation, the liability limit for
        initial inability in accordance with a) shall apply mutatis mutandis.

    d)  Liability for loss of data shall be limited to the typical expense for
        the restoration of data which would be incurred if regular backup
        copies were made appropriate for the degree of risk.

    e)  Liability in accordance with the Product Liability Act remains
        unaffected (§ 14 Product Liability Act).



6. Concluding Provisions

    a)  Oral ancillary agreements have not been concluded and shall not be
        valid. Supplements and amendments to this agreement must be in writing
        for their validity. This shall also apply in case of any amendment to
        this written form clause.

    b)  Should any provisions of this agreement be or become void or
        unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall be unaffected.

    c)  Where the user is a merchant, place of jurisdiction shall be Potsdam.

    d)  This agreement shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the
        Federal Republic of Germany. The provisions of the UN Convention on
        Contracts for the International Sale of Goods shall be excluded.
